					The contents of projects or works below may or may not be available on github.<br>
					This is due to not convolute github with non-code related projects; such as researches, presentations, very small bits of code or proprietary of an organisation/company/institution.
					<br>
					There is also the case of some projects that are uploaded to github, but won't be detailed here due to them being very simple and they are uploaded for the sake of safekeeping.

						<a href="https://github.com/datun/datun.github.io">Website/Portfolio project</a> began as an alternative CV/Resume that presents more information without the one page limit.
						<br>
						The landing page is designed to give a quick and professional looking overview of myself and the overview is further detailed with inbound links;
						<br>
						whether it is for industry or academy, there is a page that goes through the detail for the ones who seek for it.

						As the final project, we implemented an image upscaling method of "Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network".

						<h2 id="security">Securing Multi-Component SaaS</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>
						This was done in internship where the goal was securing communication between components of SaaS system.
						<br>
						The security is provided by the HTTPS protocol where internal communication uses self-signed certificates.
						<br>
						First step was researching which containers accept what kind of certificates/keys/keystore architectures. Next part is confirming that communication is secure by using Wireshark.

						<a href="https://github.com/datun/VUB-ToAIProject2019">Techniques of AI Project</a> where project subject is demonstrating a machine learning algorithm that was covered in class. For this purpose, I've chosen minimax algorithm since every implementation on web consists of tic-tac-toe and the concept of minimax would work perfectly with it.
