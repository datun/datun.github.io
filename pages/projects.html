				<p>
				The contents of projects or works below may or may not be available on github.<br>
				This is due to not convolute github with non-code related projects; such as researches, presentations, very small bits of code or proprietary of an organisation/company/institution.
				<br>
				There is also the case of some projects that are uploaded to github, but won't be detailed here due to them being very simple and they are uploaded for the sake of safekeeping.

				<h2 id="website">Personal Website/Portfolio</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/datun/datun.github.io">Website/Portfolio project</a> began as an alternative CV/Resume that presents more information without the one page limit.
				<br>
				The landing page is designed to give a quick and professional looking overview of myself and the overview is further detailed with inbound links;
				<br>
				whether it is for industry or academy, there is a page that goes through the detail for the ones who seek for it.
				</p>

				<h2 id="espcn">Image Super Resolution by Using ESPCN</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/datun/VUB-DRRA-Project2019">ESPCN Project</a> is the project for the course data representation, reduction and analysis where learning, regression, classification and visualisation are taught.
				<br>
				As the final project, we implemented an image upscaling method of "Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network".
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<h2 id="minimax">Minimax Algorithm Demonstration</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/datun/VUB-ToAIProject2019">Techniques of AI Project</a> where project subject is demonstrating a machine learning algorithm that was covered in class. For this purpose, I've chosen minimax algorithm since every implementation on web consists of tic-tac-toe and the concept of minimax would work perfectly with it.

				<h2 id="udacity">Udacity Projects - Intro to Programming Nanodegree</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
				I've applied to this nanodegree to formally show my knowledge in programming as a degree. The tasks are basic, yet last 2 of them were pleasantly interesting.
				
				<ul>
					<li> <a href="https://github.com/datun/udacity-MemoryGame-Deniz2017"> Memory Game </a>
						<p> Final project that makes use of programming concepts learned with javascript. A static page was provided by Udacity, rest of the functionalities are implemented by myself.</p>
					</li>
					<li> <a href="https://github.com/datun/udacity-MovieWebsite-Deniz2017"> Movie Website </a>
						<p> A task that combines python knowledge with html/css knowledge to generate a dynamic website by running script. </p>
					</li>
					<li> <a href="https://github.com/datun/udacity-QuizCoding-Deniz2017"> Quiz Coding </a>
						<p> A very basic madlibs game done in python as a part of basics of coding. </p>
					</li>
					<li> <a href="https://github.com/datun/udacity-my_notes2017"> HTML notes </a>
						<p> A required submission that encompasses everything that I've learned with respect to HTML and CSS part of course. </p>
